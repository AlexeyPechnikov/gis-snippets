# GIS Snippets

This repository provides Python 3 Jupyter notebooks and code snippets for GIS tasks like to

 * Spatial spectrum processing of gravity, magnetic, DEM and satellite images,

See [Super Resolution](Super Resolution) for gravity enhanced by DEM and [Elevation1 - Mashhad, Iran](Elevation1 - Mashhad, Iran) for DEM enhanced by satellite/orthophoto image by spatial spectrum transfer technique. Check the spatial correlation (coherence) and transfer the waveband with spectrum components amplitudes normalization.

 * ParaView Programmable Sources and Filters,
 * Fractality Index calculation by Gravity and DEM for density estimation,
 * Some well-known papers reproduced by spectral approach,
 * Google Earth Engine Javascript snippets,
 * Amazon AWS EC2 initialization shell script for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic GIS installation,
 * etc.
