## How to load data into ParaView using it's ProgrammableSource feature

There are some different ways to enhance ParaView features by custom Python code:

1. Use Python console (the best way for one-time commands which are outside of the processing pipeline),
2. Use [Programmable Source](ProgrammableSource/README.md) (the best way for custom code without pipeline input and the complete processing pipeline),
3. Use [Programmable Filter](ProgrammableFilter/README.md) (the best way for custom code with pipeline input and the complete processing pipeline),
4. Use Plugins (the best way for well formalized code modules).
